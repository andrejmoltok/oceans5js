Describes how the game should or could be played.

1. **Ship Placement:**
    - **Objective:** Strategically position your fleet on the game grid without overlapping ships.
    - **Rules:** Each player can place their ships without overlapping, allowing ships to touch but not occupy the same space. Choose from five different ship types, each with varying lengths: Carrier (5 spaces), Battleship (4 spaces), Cruiser (3 spaces), Submarine (3 spaces), and Destroyer (2 spaces). Use careful planning and tactical placement to establish a formidable naval formation.
2. **AI Strategist Suggestions:**
    - **Feature:** Utilize an AI strategist to receive tactical suggestions for your next firing move.
    - **Functionality:** Each player has access to an AI strategist, which provides intelligent recommendations on where to target your next shot. Benefit from strategic insights and maximize your chances of hitting enemy ships. The AI strategist enhances gameplay by offering valuable guidance and assisting players in making informed decisions during battleship engagements.
3. **Firing Mechanism:**
    - **Options:** Execute firing actions through grid cell selection or coordinate input.
    - **Interaction:** Engage in firing actions by clicking on specific grid cells or inputting coordinates into the designated input field. For example, you can target cell A-6 to launch an attack. Choose your preferred method of firing and coordinate with your strategic objectives to effectively eliminate enemy vessels.
    - **Optional Messaging:** With each firing action, players have the option to include an optional message to send to their opponent. Enhance communication and strategic coordination by exchanging messages during gameplay. Whether conveying tactical insights or friendly banter, the optional messaging feature adds an additional layer of interaction and immersion to battleship engagements.
4. Limited Number of Firing Action:
	1. **Tactical Decision-Making:** With a limited number of firing actions available, players must carefully strategize and prioritize their shots. Each firing action becomes more valuable, requiring players to consider factors such as ship placement, opponent's likely positions, and potential defensive maneuvers.
	2. **Resource Management:** Players must manage their limited resources effectively throughout the game. They may need to decide whether to conserve firing actions for critical moments or use them strategically to gain tactical advantages. This introduces an element of resource scarcity that adds depth to the gameplay experience.
    3. **Risk Assessment:** Limited firing actions necessitate careful risk assessment. Players must weigh the potential benefits of each shot against the risk of missing or wasting their limited opportunities. This encourages players to take calculated risks and make strategic decisions based on the current state of the game.
    4. **Increased Intensity:** The finite number of firing actions adds a sense of urgency and intensity to the gameplay. As the game progresses and resources dwindle, tension mounts as players race to secure victory before exhausting their limited opportunities. This heightened sense of pressure can lead to thrilling and dramatic gameplay moments.
