Describes how the game should or could be played.

1. **Ship Placement:**
    - **Objective:** Strategically position your fleet on the game grid without overlapping ships.
    - **Rules:** Each player can place their ships without overlapping, allowing ships to touch but not occupy the same space. Choose from five different ship types, each with varying lengths: Carrier (5 spaces), Battleship (4 spaces), Cruiser (3 spaces), Submarine (3 spaces), and Destroyer (2 spaces). Use careful planning and tactical placement to establish a formidable naval formation.
2. **AI Strategist Suggestions:**
    - **Feature:** Utilize an AI strategist to receive tactical suggestions for your next firing move.
    - **Functionality:** Each player has access to an AI strategist, which provides intelligent recommendations on where to target your next shot. Benefit from strategic insights and maximize your chances of hitting enemy ships. The AI strategist enhances gameplay by offering valuable guidance and assisting players in making informed decisions during battleship engagements.
3. **Firing Mechanism:**
    - **Options:** Execute firing actions through grid cell selection or coordinate input.
    - **Interaction:** Engage in firing actions by clicking on specific grid cells or inputting coordinates into the designated input field. For example, you can target cell A-6 to launch an attack. Choose your preferred method of firing and coordinate with your strategic objectives to effectively eliminate enemy vessels.
    - **Optional Messaging:** With each firing action, players have the option to include an optional message to send to their opponent. Enhance communication and strategic coordination by exchanging messages during gameplay. Whether conveying tactical insights or friendly banter, the optional messaging feature adds an additional layer of interaction and immersion to battleship engagements.
4. Limited Number of Firing Action:
	1. **Tactical Decision-Making:** With a limited number of firing actions available, players must carefully strategize and prioritize their shots. Each firing action becomes more valuable, requiring players to consider factors such as ship placement, opponent's likely positions, and potential defensive maneuvers.
	2. **Resource Management:** Players must manage their limited resources effectively throughout the game. They may need to decide whether to conserve firing actions for critical moments or use them strategically to gain tactical advantages. This introduces an element of resource scarcity that adds depth to the gameplay experience.
    3. **Risk Assessment:** Limited firing actions necessitate careful risk assessment. Players must weigh the potential benefits of each shot against the risk of missing or wasting their limited opportunities. This encourages players to take calculated risks and make strategic decisions based on the current state of the game.
    4. **Increased Intensity:** The finite number of firing actions adds a sense of urgency and intensity to the gameplay. As the game progresses and resources dwindle, tension mounts as players race to secure victory before exhausting their limited opportunities. This heightened sense of pressure can lead to thrilling and dramatic gameplay moments.
    5. **Dynamic Shot Counter:** 
	    1. **Strategic Incentive:** Successfully sinking enemy vessels becomes even more rewarding, as it not only eliminates a threat but also provides players with additional firing opportunities. This creates a strategic incentive for players to prioritize their attacks and target high-value enemy ships, such as Carriers and Battleships, to maximize their shot counter gains.	
	    2. **Resource Management:** The shot counter mechanic introduces an additional layer of resource management, as players must consider the potential long-term benefits of sinking enemy vessels. They may need to weigh the immediate tactical advantages of eliminating certain ships against the potential shot counter gains they could receive for sinking higher-value targets.
	    3. **Risk vs. Reward:** Players must carefully balance the risk of exposing their own ships to counterattacks with the potential reward of increasing their shot counter. This adds a strategic element of risk assessment to gameplay, as players must evaluate the trade-offs between offensive aggression and defensive caution.
	    4. **Dynamic Gameplay Progression:** The shot counter mechanic contributes to dynamic gameplay progression, as successful hits directly impact the flow of the game. As players accumulate shot counter increases through sinking enemy vessels, the balance of power can shift, leading to evolving strategic opportunities and challenges throughout the match.
